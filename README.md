# Climate Data Plotting
These are the python and MATLAB scripts I use to custom plot climate data for my research work.



**Contents:**
- **environment.yml:** Required Python packages and their versions.
- **Jupyter_Notebook_python/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with code examples
- **Jupyter_Notebook (MATLAB)/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with MATLAB code examples
- **MATLAB, python, PDF folders**: Contains .m, .py and PDF versions of the Jupyter notebooks



**Jupyter Notebooks:**

- **Jupyter_Notebook_python/IMD_Rainfall_Plots.ipynb**  Rainfall data plotting using xarray and proplot.
- **Jupyter_Notebook_python/Andhra_rainfall_plots.ipynb** Subset a region and mask a NetCDF file with a shapefile and plot with shapefile overlaid.
- **point_map_cartopy.ipynb, point_map.ipynb** WIP! Need to open in Google Colab for now.
   

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.10
- xarray
- proplot
- geopandas
- cartopy
